## River Conditions

With such an overload of data on the USGS site, and the hard-to-navigate UI, it's difficult to get on the site and quickly get the basic data a fisherman might want to know about a river (i.e. the current flows).

I built this so a user can quickly find the river they're looking for and get only the data they actually want.

Most fisherman don't want all the scientific data behind a river, they just want to see the flows.

The app is built in Next.js and uses TypeScript. I also used Tailwind to get some quick styling. PR's welcome if you'd like to contribute!
